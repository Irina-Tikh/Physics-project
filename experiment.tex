\section{Experiment}

The needed elements were provided by ETH, the setup was constructed and propery aligned manually.

Figure \ref{fig:setup_notsetup} shows the setup as it was provided, all elements were aligned manually and later screwed in place.


\subsection{Fine-tuning and Intensity Optimisation}

After the elements were screwed in place, the mirrors, notch filter and optical cable coupler were adjusted using the screws in the stands in order to optimize signal. A different laser was used to align the mirrors behind the notch filter.

The integration time was adjusted so that the maximum peaks in were between 10'000 and 15'000 instances, then averaged out of 10 scans no negate small errors. One such scan was recorded without a sample, to record background noise.
